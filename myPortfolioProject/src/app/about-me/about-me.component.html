      <h3>Who am I</h3>
      <p>Welcome to my website. I am Laura González, a third-year student pursuing a degree in Computer Engineering,
        with expectations of graduating in 2024.
        <br><br>
        Throughout my academic journey, I have actively engaged in numerous projects, enabling me to cultivate essential
        skills in teamwork, communication, and adaptability. I firmly believe in the significance of collaborating with
        diverse individuals and leveraging a variety of perspectives to generate innovative solutions.
        <br><br>
        I have received a solid education in web and mobile development, equipping me with a strong understanding of
        languages such as HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and experience with frameworks like Angular and Ionic.

        Additionally, I have a keen interest in cloud computing and how it is transforming the way businesses operate
        and store data.
        <br><br>
        In addition to my computer engineering training, I pursued the International Baccalaureate and the Spanish
        Scientific Baccalaureate at Heidelberg College concurrently. This diverse educational background has not only
        enhanced my adaptability to different environments and educational approaches but also allowed me to focus on
        developing proficiency in languages such as English and German. This linguistic component of my education
        complements my technical knowledge, enabling me to effectively collaborate and communicate in international
        settings.
        <br><br>
        As a student, my goal is to constantly grow and develop both personally and professionally. I have a strong
        desire to embrace new challenges and expand my horizons.
