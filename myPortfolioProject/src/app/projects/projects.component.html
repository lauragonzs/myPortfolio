        <h2>Medical Aesthetics Clinic Webpage</h2>
      </a>
      <p class="project-description">
        The goal of this project was to create a visually appealing and easy-to-use platform that allows the clients of
        an aesthetic clinic to explore treatments and promotions, easily contact the clinic and access their
        personalized profile. The website was designed to be responsive, providing an optimal experience on mobile and
        tablet devices.
        <br><br>
        To bring this project to life, I used a combination of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript in the early stages. These
        technologies allowed me to build the core functionalities of the website, ensuring smooth navigation, form
        submission, and user authentication. Data storage and authentication were handled using Firebase. The design
        phase was made easier by the use of Figma, a powerful design tool that helped me create aesthetically pleasing
        interfaces. I selected a color palette with the help of an artificial intelligence, ensuring a consistent and
        visually appealing appearance throughout the website.
        <br><br>
        To manage the project efficiently, I used Trello. This allowed me to organize tasks, track progress, and
        collaborate effectively with the team. Through the use of agile methodologies and task prioritization, I ensured
        a smooth and timely development process.
        <br><br>
        As the project progressed, I recognized the need for a more robust and scalable framework. Consequently, I
        migrated the website to the Angular framework. This transition provided improved performance and
        maintainability, ensuring future scalability.
        <br><br>
        The final result was an aesthetically pleasing and functional website where clients could explore treatments,
        easily contact the clinic through intuitive forms, and access personalized profiles. They could also take
        advantage of promotions and refer to the Frequently Asked Questions section (FAQ).

        <h2>Librarium</h2>
      </a>
      <p class="project-description">
        Librarium is an innovative website that offers a subscription-based online library service, giving subscribed
        users the opportunity to access a wide variety of books digitally.
        <br><br>
        To carry out this project, I used Angular Framework and Firebase, in order to manage user authentication and
        store the database in the cloud.
        <br><br>
        The website has a wide number of outstanding features. Firstly, a book details section has been developed, where
        users can get detailed information about each work. In addition, a book reading page has been implemented,
        allowing users to change the language and enjoy a personalized reading experience. The page also has a reviews
        section, where users can share their opinions and comments about the books.
        <br><br>
        In order to facilitate the search for books, an advanced search section has been incorporated, which allows
        users to filter by title, author or category. An audiobook section has also been included, giving users the
        option to enjoy audio narrations. The user profiles are a fundamental part of the page, since they allow each
        user to have a personalized follow-up of their favourites, read and pending books.
        <br><br>
        In addition, an administrator panel has been developed that provides additional functionalities. The admin can
        perform a full CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) of users and books, as well as remove inappropriate reviews.
        This guarantees efficient and safe control of the platform.
        <br><br>
        In terms of design, special attention has been paid to the user experience. The website offers the option of
        light mode and dark mode, adapting to the individual preferences of each user. In addition, we have used an API
        to offer the option to switch the language between English and Spanish, with the aim of obtaining more users.
        <br><br>
        To ensure a smooth and secure subscription experience, we have used a fee payment API, allowing users to manage
        their membership easily and securely.
        <br><br>
        The website is complete and offers a wide range of functionalities that provide reading-loving users with an
        enriching and satisfying experience, being more than a viable production-ready minimum.
